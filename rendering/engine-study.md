Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor was released in 2014. The game itself was a great surprise, and the fact that 
it was a spin-off within the storyline of the Lord of the Rings universe was quite unusual and it’s something 
I enjoyed. The game was a great success, and at the time of writing, Monolith has already released the sequel, 
Shadow of War. The game’s graphics are beautiful, especially considering it was a cross-generation game and 
was also released on Xbox 360 and PS3. The PC version is quite polished and features a few extra graphical 
options and hi-resolution texture packs that make it shine.

The game uses a relatively modern deferred DX11 renderer. I used Renderdoc to delve into the game’s rendering 
techniques. I used the highest possible graphical settings (ultra) and enabled all the bells and whistles like 
order-independent transparency, tessellation, screen-space occlusion and the different motion blurs.

The final chapter Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain was released in 2015 and brings the series to a whole 
new level of graphics quality thanks to the Fox Engine developed by Kojima Productions. The analysis below 
is based on the PC version of the game with all the quality knobs set to maximum. Some of the information I 
present here has already been made public in the GDC 2013 session “Photorealism Through the Eyes of a FOX”.

## DOOM (2016) - Graphics Study

The new DOOM is a perfect addition to the franchise, using the new id Tech 6 engine where ex-Crytek 
Tiago Sousa now assumes the role of lead renderer programmer after John Carmack’s departure.
Historically id Software is known for open-sourcing their engines after a few years, which often 
leads to nice remakes and breakdowns. Whether this will stand true with id Tech 6 remains to be seen 
but we don’t necessarily need the source code to appreciate the nice graphics techniques implemented 
in the engine.

## Unreal Engine 4 Rendering Part 1: Introduction

Unreal Engine 4’s rendering system is endlessly configurable and supports most of the latest generation rendering techniques across multiple platforms. Writing materials in Unreal is very accessible thanks to the node-based editor but people are often hesitant about diving in deeper than that due to the rendering system’s complexity and lack of accessible educational content.

## Rendering and shading in ADAM: Episode 3

In the striking, real-time ADAM films, a number of components come together in Unity to deliver 
the effects that have gained so much attention. In this post, we focus on just two aspects – albeit 
very important aspects – of how Oats Studios achieved such memorable effects. So if you’d like 
to know more about the custom shaders that these artists used, and real-time rendering of just one 
frame with Unity 2017.1, read on!
