Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor was released in 2014. The game itself was a great surprise, and the fact that 
it was a spin-off within the storyline of the Lord of the Rings universe was quite unusual and it’s something 
I enjoyed. The game was a great success, and at the time of writing, Monolith has already released the sequel, 
Shadow of War. The game’s graphics are beautiful, especially considering it was a cross-generation game and 
was also released on Xbox 360 and PS3. The PC version is quite polished and features a few extra graphical 
options and hi-resolution texture packs that make it shine.

The game uses a relatively modern deferred DX11 renderer. I used Renderdoc to delve into the game’s rendering 
techniques. I used the highest possible graphical settings (ultra) and enabled all the bells and whistles like 
order-independent transparency, tessellation, screen-space occlusion and the different motion blurs.

The final chapter Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain was released in 2015 and brings the series to a whole 
new level of graphics quality thanks to the Fox Engine developed by Kojima Productions. The analysis below 
is based on the PC version of the game with all the quality knobs set to maximum. Some of the information I 
present here has already been made public in the GDC 2013 session “Photorealism Through the Eyes of a FOX”.
