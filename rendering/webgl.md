# WebGL, Three.js Rendering Tutorials, Techniques

This document contains all interesting topics I found related to usage of Three.js and WebGL 1/2.

## Three.js Basic Shaders
[Experimenting with Three.js shaders and the ShaderMaterial](https://2pha.com/blog/experimenting-threejs-shaders-and-shadermaterial/)

Simple but useful set of shaders for Three.js. Helped me to understand what pre-defined constants, matrices available.
It worked better for me because reading Three.js code with its fragmented shaders is not very fun.
